## What i have learnt By working on this project
1. I have improved my self in `background-image` properties by working in this project
2. Have researched and learnt `animation` and `keyframes` in css before that i thought JS was necessary for animations

## Honest Time to finish the project

I had took about 1hr 22min I worked to make it as similar as possible but got stuck while displaying the pink blob. Have adjusted and made it different so it looks cooler
